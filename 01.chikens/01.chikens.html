<h1>Chicken</h1>

<p>The <b>chickens</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
  such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
  for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
  adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
  Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China according to estimations in the study of the
  sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd
  centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and
  as pets.
  Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
  2018,[5] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[6] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[6] There
  are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

  Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
  Asia,[7] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
  subcontinent.
  From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[8] Fowl
  have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
  the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[9][10][11]
  In 2011 a study in genetic and archaeological[12] evidence conclude that the origin of the modern-day chicken is from
  South-East Asia. This is the area east of India and south of China.
